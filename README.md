# COSC 420-001 High Performance Computing
# Author: Ryan Rosiak
# Teacher: Joseph Anderson
# Contributor: [Grant Dawson](https://github.com/dawsboss)
<br /> <br />
## Course Overview:
The course will study principles, practices, and implementations of parallel and distributed computing. It covers three areas of high performance computing: modern computing architectures, algorithm design, and applications and programming. Through this course, students will not only learn fundamental concepts of high performance computing but also gain hands-on hardware and programming experience in this field.

## Major Projects:
### Project 1 Project Euler:
#### Authors: Ryan Rosiak, Grant Dawson, and Brock Forscythe
#### Description:
This project showcases applications of parallel computing to solve thought provoking questions from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). See more details within the project
folder.
### Project 2 arXiv Search Engine:
#### Authors: Ryan Rosiak and Grant Dawson
#### Description:
This project contains the first attempted portion of a search engine using PageRank and HITS algorithms in order to search for research papers by keyword.
### Project 3 arXiv Search Engine Continued:
#### Authors: Ryan Rosiak and Grant Dawson
#### Description:
This project is the continuation of project 2 and is the current up to date version of the final product. Modules have been added and updated in order to move closer to a finished
product.
